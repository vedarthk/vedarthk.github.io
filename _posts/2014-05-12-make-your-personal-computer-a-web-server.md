title: Make your personal computer a Web Server
---

Always wanted to access your personal computer (PC) over the Internet, here you are, you can do it for free.

Most (almost all) of us have Internet connection with IP address changing every time you connect (Dynamic IP). You need to know your IP address to access your machine over the Internet. One way of doing this is to use some Dynamic DNS provider, but you need to pay to use their service.

We want everything for FREE, following are few things which will you will have to do :

1. Domain Name

You need to have a domain name to map your dynamic IP address to your domain name. If you don't have a domain name, you can register on http://www.dot.tk

2. CloudFlare Account (FREE)
