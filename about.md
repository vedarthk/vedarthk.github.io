  Hi, I am a Python Developer [@aplopio](http://aplopio.com) where we develop [Recruiterbox](http://recruiterbox.com) and contribute to open source.

This is just another blog on Internet which might / or might not help you. My motivation behind writing this blog is to keep track of things that I do and make my life easy.

Also I like to get things for **FREE**, so you might find few posts which will guide you on how to get things for free.

**Tip: Use Twitter**


Thanks for reading!
