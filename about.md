  Nowdays, every one is blogging. Internet is full of various blogs, most of them are to help people in one or the other way. Even I want to blog, but I want to write things which are not easy to search on the Internet, then you might think I am adding yet another blog, but no!, I am not, this blog is my log. I want to use this platform to jot things down and then later in future I can easily refer to them.

Conclusion, you might/not find posts on this blog useful. I work at [Aplopio](http://aplopio.com) with a great team, we develop a awesome applicant tracking system called [Recruiterbox](http://recruiterbox.com) using [Python](http://www.python.org) & [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com).

Thanks for reading!
